# UNIX

This is an interactive talk about UNIX and Python.

## Outline

- Lots of people are scared of terminals but they can be really cool!
- What is a CLI?
- Python and CLIs
  - Wiki CLI
  - Sentiment Analysis CLI
  - Twitter CLI
- Hackers love CLIs! There are many reasons for that
- Why write command line programs?
  - Glue applications together (compare Wiki sentiments of Python vs COBOL)
  - Easier to write and collaborate on
  - Useful to automate stuff (average sentiment of a Wiki page over time)
  - Scripts are like vampires and never die
- UNIX Philosophy
- Practical problem solving
  - Iterative and composable. You build them interactively
  - A complicated 4 line pipeline started as a single command that was gradually refined into something that actually solves a complicated problem
- Benefits
  - Streaming
  - Parallelizing
  - Composability
- Interesting tools
  - `jq`
  - `curl`
  - `xargs`
  - many more!
- There are millions of ways to build UNIX pipelines! :)
