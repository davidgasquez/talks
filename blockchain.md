## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralised database. In the real world, if someone gives you something, you would own it. But on the internet this is not so easy - he could have just copied the information and now 2 persons own the same thing.

### What about cryptocurrencies?

Originally, currencies were actual precious metals, like gold and silver coins. For the sake of portability, these were replaced with bank notes - pieces of paper which entitled the bearer to a certain quantity of precious metal if they presented them to the bank. That system is known as the gold standard.

The gold standard was abandoned in the middle of the 20th century. Now we have ‘fiat money’, which is money that has value simply because everyone agrees it has value. The biggest difference between 20 real dollars and 20 Monopoly dollars now is that you can use the real dollars to pay taxes.

Now that we have an easy way to do consensus in the internet, cryptocurrencies are simply a digial version of money. When you buy Bitcoin you're using the Blockchain to tell it to everyone. If you're going to spend more than you have, everyone will be able to see it!
