# Data Science in Realily

A talk to share my failures, learnings, and hopes for the data space.

## Motivation

People talk about their shiny new algorithm or how much a new set of parameters improved the accuracy of a complex Neural Network.
I'd say that's the easy part about working with data.

This talk focus on the rest of the pipeline, sharing challenges and mistakes I encountered.
The talk contains some of the ideas I wish to have read or hear myself when starting to work in data science.

## Outline

### Warning

- The talk is biased from my experience
- Tips shared here will be difficult to implement
- The data landscape is evolving really fast and some advices shared here might be dated soon

### Why

- Data talks are mostly algorithm focused
- Working with data is not easy
- I made a lot of mistakes I want to share
- Data can change everything! How?
- The issue with Kaggle is that it provides the CSV. You don't have that in real life

### The Power of Data

- With data, we can improve applying the scientific method. And... science works!
- Data makes choices clearer distinguishing the signal from the noise
- Has applications in every field, from web A/B Testing to ML in Biology

### Data Applications

- Answering questions
- Predicting stuff; spam, churn, prices
- A/B Testing

### My Mistakes

- Getting the data was easy (Kaggle CSV)
- Working with data was simple
- Starting a project from the ground up could fix everything
- Data was enought

### Learnings

- Reproducibility
    - Required for the scientific method
    - Required to keep you sane
- Everything is an event and events dont change!
- Learn many tools
- Combine the tools! (Unix pipe)
- KISS
- Have a baseline metric for everything you want to affect
- Keep your data tidy
- Explore and iterate quickly to learn unknowns unknowns
    - e.g normalizing the variables. If you don't you'll have a ranking!
- Let it crash. Some entropy is required. (forest controlled fires)
- Data starts and end with people
    - Focus is scarce. Lines of code are cheap. Optimize for people.

### The Future

- Streaming
- Containers
- Serverless
- NN

## Quotes

- Most of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using their gut. They will be either lucky or wrong
- Theories come and go, but fundamental data always remain the same
